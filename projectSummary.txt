1. npx create-react-app 
2. for designing run this command, npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0shopping and then paste this line 
in your index.js file - import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
3. for icons - npm install react-icons and import cart icon FaShoppingCart
4. for creating page and for navigating purpose - npm i react-router-dom
  Important change in react router :-
    react router v6 doesn't support exact anymore.
    // old - v5 <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
    // new - v6 <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    As stated in their documentation:
    You don't need to use an exact prop on <Route path="/"> anymore. 
    This is because all paths match exactly by default. 
    If you want to match more of the URL because you have child routes use a trailing * as in <Route path="users/*">.
5. For getting fake data we took help from faker which generates fake data : - npm i faker but this command 
or this faker repo isn't working so we will be using old version like npm i @withshepherd/faker
